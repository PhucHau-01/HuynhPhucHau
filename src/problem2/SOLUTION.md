. Overview Architecture
You need a high availability (HA), scalable, and cost-effective system that ensures:

Fault tolerance: The system remains operational even if a component fails.
Scalability: The system can scale horizontally as traffic increases.
High performance: Handles 500 requests/sec with p99 < 100ms response time.
Key Components:
Load Balancer (ALB/NLB)

Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
Amazon Network Load Balancer (NLB) for higher performance needs.
Compute Layer (ECS, EKS, Lambda)

AWS Fargate (ECS) or EKS (Kubernetes) for running microservices.
AWS Lambda for short-lived (event-driven) tasks.
Database Layer

Amazon RDS (Aurora MySQL/PostgreSQL): A relational database with automatic scaling.
Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL for fast transaction session storage.
Caching Layer

Amazon ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) to reduce database load.
AWS Global Accelerator to optimize latency.
Messaging & Event-driven Architecture

Amazon SQS (Queue) for asynchronous transaction order processing.
Amazon SNS/Kafka on MSK for fast information delivery.
Monitoring & Logging

Amazon CloudWatch for performance monitoring.
AWS X-Ray for debugging request latency.
AWS WAF & Shield for system protection.
Security & Compliance

AWS IAM for access control.
AWS KMS for data encryption.
AWS Cognito for user authentication.
2. Why Choose AWS Services & Alternatives
Each AWS service is selected based on its strengths in handling high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, there are alternative solutions available:

ALB/NLB (Application Load Balancer / Network Load Balancer): Chosen for automatic load balancing across instances. Alternatives include HAProxy and Nginx.
ECS/EKS (Elastic Container Service / Elastic Kubernetes Service): Provides flexible container management with easy scaling. An alternative is running EC2 instances with auto-scaling.
RDS Aurora (Relational Database Service - Aurora): Offers high performance and automatic scaling for relational databases. Alternatives include self-managed MySQL or PostgreSQL.
DynamoDB: A NoSQL database providing fast retrieval and minimal maintenance. Alternatives include MongoDB and Cassandra.
ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached): Reduces database load by caching frequently accessed data. An alternative is managing Redis manually.
SQS/SNS (Simple Queue Service / Simple Notification Service): Enables event-driven processing and message queuing. Alternatives include RabbitMQ and Kafka.
CloudWatch: Provides system-wide monitoring, logging, and alerts. Alternatives include Prometheus and Grafana.
3. Scaling Plan
Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to scale EC2 instances as traffic increases.
Aurora Auto-Scaling to add read replicas.
DynamoDB On-Demand for flexible scaling.
Edge caching with CloudFront to reduce backend load.
